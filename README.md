Prediction of Molecular Free Energy Using Graph Neural Networks
We employ graph neural networks to forecast the free energy of the molecules. Graph data
generated from the MolE8 molecule dataset was used to train the model. In the experiments,
graph convolutional networks graph attention networks, and message passing neural networks
were used to compare the performances. With a mean absolute error of 24.01 kcal mol-1, the
graph attention network produced the best results. The graph attention network allows us to
build a more precise representation of the molecules since it allows us to perform operations on
multi-dimensional edge features. The results have been compared to MPNN model, which is
another architecture that allows the use of multi-dimensional edge features. We demonstrate
the significance of appending molecular-level features to node-level features for predicting the
free energies of the molecule.
